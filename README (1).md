1. Using the BigDecimal documentation, create a method that accepts a BigDecimal and returns a double of the BigDecimal number rounded to the nearest hundredth.
For example, 4.2545 should return 4.25.

2. Using the BigDecimal documentation, create a method that accepts a BigDecimal, reverses the sign (if the parameter is positive, the result should be negative and vice versa), rounds the number to the nearest tenth and returns the result. For example, 1.2345 should return -1.2 and -45.67 should return 45.7.

3. Suppose you are building a Car inventory system. All cars have a vinNumber, make, model, and mileage. But no Car is just a Car. Each Car is either a Sedan, a UtilityVehicle, or a Truck. UtilityVehicles have a boolean that represents whether they have fourWheelDrive. Trucks have a numeric towingCapacity. Create an Abstract Class named Car and 3 classes that extend Car called Sedan, UtilityVehicle, and Truck.

4. Suppose you are building a video streaming service. All Videos are either tv series or movies. Create classes TvSeries and Movie which extend an Abstract class Video. Add a few methods and properties to each.

5. Create an IntList Interface. An IntList is simply a way to store an ordered list of integers.
- All IntLists should have an add method by which a user can a new number to the list.
- All IntLists should have a get method by which users can retrieve an element by id.
- You will need two implementations of IntList.
- The first implementation is IntArrayList. IntArrayList should store numbers in an array with a length of 10 by default. When the add method is called, you must first determine if the array is full. If it is, create a new array that is 50% larger, move all elements over to the new array and add the new element. (for example, an array of length 10 would be increased to 15)
- The second implementation is IntVector. IntVector should store numbers in an array with a length of 20 by default. When the add method is called, you must first determine if the array is full. If it is, create a new array that is double the size of the current array, move all elements over to the new array and add the new element. (for example, an array of length 10 would be increased to 20)
- In your README.md include an example of when IntArrayList would be more efficient and when IntVector would be more efficient.
